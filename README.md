another GitHub repo. so I don't forget how to make these!

yesterday (May 31st 2018) was a good day. I opened at Starbucks, went for a jog, went to Goodwill with Emlee and we found dresses for the summer. After I dropped her off I delivered some donuts to Jen and Brendan (and Aj) at Starbucks and then I had chips and guacamole for dinner with Brii.

Yikes I messed this up, lol!
